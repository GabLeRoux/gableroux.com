Hey there,  
This site is still maintained! I was running my personal site on [pelican][pelican] and I just decided to move to [jekyll][Jekyll]!

<!-- more -->

I had a small anoying problem with Pelican's assets plugin and didn't want to put time on fixing this. I told myself "ok I'll continue writing when I fix this", but turns out it never happened. Switching to an other static site generator ended up being faster to setup than playing with my old code. Yeah, I'm a bit lazy, [that makes good programers right?][bill-gates-quote]. :)

That being said, I'll do my homeworks and I'll be posting here for real by following my [static site generator's Philosophy][staticgen-jekyll];

> Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.

You got it, I'll focus on content.

## What's new?

Well, since my last post (a year ago), a lot of things happened! These are the key points:

 * I started working at [TLM][tlm], a nice place with nice people where I write code, fix problems and close Jira issues. I'm often asked what's TLM? In a nutshell, we do a lot of things such as websites, webapps, mobile apps and some support. We worked on a car starting mobile app once and that was pretty cool ;)

 * I gave a few presentations at the [SagLac IO][saglacio] about coffeescript, python and command line tools. [I will give an other one][saglacio-facebook-event] soon on [Hubot][hubot] (HUBOT - Improve and reduce employee efficiency). I will share my presentations in a new post once the presentation is over.

 * I started a partnership: [Totema Studio][totemastudio], an independant video game Studio where I am building awesome games with awesome people.

As one can read here, it's been a buzy year, I'll share more thoughts on my site now that it's "fixed" ;)
