> I want to contribute to the open source world and become someone better, where do I start?

This blog post can show you.

<!-- more -->

Yet an other presentation at the [SagLacIO][saglacio]. What is open source? What is our place in the world? How can I make the world better? **Contribute to open source, it will!**

## Getting started

Install ruby and start having fun:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo gem install fastlane
fastlane init
{% endhighlight %}

Then follow instructions. If your app has both ios and android (ex; cordova, ionic, react native, hybrid project), I recommend starting with ios. You can add android support later by [following the android documentation](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/).
