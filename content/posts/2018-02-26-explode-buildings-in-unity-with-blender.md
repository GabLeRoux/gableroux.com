During the [WonderJam 2018](https://jam.aemi.ca), our team at [Totema Studio][totemastudio] created [City Crashers][city-crashers], a game where you are a huge robot in a city, and your mission is to destroy everything. In 48h, we built an amazing multiplayer game where players compete to get the highest score, or the biggest bill.

Here's a forked version of the related project we used to handle building destruction:
