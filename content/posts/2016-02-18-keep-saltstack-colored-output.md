Not an expert with Salt yet, but wow, saltstack is such a great tool! Like colored output? What about saving colors to your log files? Chrome extension inside (help needed!)

<!-- todo: add some example results for salt output, but the idea is here -->

> Hey, before we begin, I started playing around with colors in a terminal and tough it could be cool to have a chrome extension for this. Let's create [<i class="fa fa-github"></i> ANSI colors chrome extension][ansi-colors-chrome-extension] together!

## Alright let's begin

Saltstack's output has colors for the great good, green when result is pass, pink when it's modified and red when it fails.

![saltstack-output-example](/images/colors-in-shell-saltstack.png)

Easy to see when something goes wrong. Now when you start running commands on multiple servers, salt is very handy, but what if you'd like to share the output with a teammate? Go for it, copy paste, plain white/black text or take a screenshot of your terminal? Continue reading for a solution ;)

## Console colors

See [Bash Prompt HOWTO: Colors][Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x329] for reference ;)

Here are some env variable colors

{% highlight text %}
export TEXT_BLACK=$'\033'\[30m
export TEXT_RED=$'\033'\[31m
export TEXT_GREEN=$'\033'\[32m
export TEXT_YELLOW=$'\033'\[33m
export TEXT_BLUE=$'\033'\[34m
export TEXT_MAGENTA=$'\033'\[35m
export TEXT_CYAN=$'\033'\[36m
export TEXT_WHITE=$'\033'\[37m
```

Values are [ANSI Escape Codes][ANSI_escape_code] and the environment variables above comes by default with [Oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh] :)
 
```bash
echo "$TEXT_CYAN colors $TEXT_GREEN are $TEXT_RED mainstream"
```

![example for the above](/images/colors-in-shell-example.png)

## Colors and files

Now, depending on your shell, writing this to a shell with `>` should keep these ANSI characters, so when you `cat` the file again, you should see it with colors.

```bash
echo "$TEXT_CYAN colors $TEXT_GREEN are $TEXT_RED mainstream" > colored_file.txt && cat colored_file.txt
```

In my case, colors are kept (using [Oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh] with [iterm2 terminal emulator][iterm2]) and I'm happy with it, but sometimes, it's not the case depending on the command or the shell being used.

## Read colored output from file

Depending on your shell environment, `less` command may not need additional parameters, but if you try to pipe a colored file to `less` and don't get any colors, try with `-r` parameter:

```bash
cat colored_file.txt | less -r
```

Thanks to [this answer on stackoverflow](http://superuser.com/a/36045/55267) and its comments.

## keep salt colored output

Haven't talked much about salt in current post so lets begin. Writing salt output to a file doesn't keep ANSI colors. Luckily for us, salt command has a `--force-color` parameter [added in salt issue #4121][salt#4121].

![Salt colored output example](/images/salt-colored-output.png)

Solution to keep salt output looks like this:

```bash
salt-call state.highstate -l debug --force-color > salt.log
```

```bash
cat salt.log
```

Awesome, salt colors!

## What about clear text (no color)?

I you want to remove colors from output, there are a few solutions available, here's a [question asking for a regex to remove ANSI Escape codes](http://superuser.com/q/380772/55267). My favorite answer is [ansi-strip-cli npm module][strip-ansi-cli]

```bash
npm install --g strip-ansi-cli
```

Usage:

```bash
cat colored_file.txt | strip-ansi
```

No more colors ðŸ˜Ž

Otherwise, you can strip output with `perl -pe 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*[mG]//g'` which is perfect if you don't want node.

```bash
cat colored_file.txt | perl -pe 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*[mG]//g'
```

## salt solution

So with salt, I managed to get both output using the following:

```bash
salt-call state.highstate -l debug --force-color \
| tee salt-colored.log \
| tee >(strip-ansi > salt.log)
```

Prefer not to bloat your system with npm?

```bash
salt-call state.highstate -l debug --force-color \
| tee salt-colored.log \
| tee >(perl -pe 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*[mG]//g' > salt.log)
```

Now you can enjoy salt output in both ways :)

```bash
cat salt-colored.log
cat salt.log
```

## What's the `tee` command?

Thanks to [tldr pages][tldr]

```bash
tldr tee
```

{% highlight text %}
  tee
  Read from standard input and write to standard output and files.

  - Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output:
    echo "example" | tee FILE

  - Append to the given FILEs, do not overwrite:
    echo "example" | tee -a FILE
```

## Some random stuff because why not

Cool, you've reached this far, get [lolcat](http://osxdaily.com/2014/07/03/lolcat-rainbow-terminal-command-output/) for the lolz

```bash
gem install lolcat
```
