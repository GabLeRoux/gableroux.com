Hey there,  
This site is still *maintained*! I was running my personal site on [pelican][pelican] and I just decided to move to [jekyll][Jekyll], it's more popular and easier to maintain.

<!--more-->

## Why jekyll?

I had a small annoying problem with Pelican's assets plugin and didn't want to put time on fixing this. I remember telling myself:

> Ok I'll continue writing on my blog once it's fixed...

Switching to an other static site generator ended up being **way faster** than playing with my old code. Yeah, I'm a bit lazy, [that makes good programmers][bill-gates-quote] right?. :)

Now that everything is ok, I'll follow [jekyll's Philosophy][staticgen-jekyll];

> Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.

## What's new?

Since my last post (more than a year ago), a lot happened! These are some key points:

### [TLM][tlm]

![Solutions TLM](/images/tlm/solutions-tlm-saguenay.png)

I started working with a great team at a nice place where I write code, fix problems and close [Jira][jira] issues. People often ask me what we do at TLM, so in a nutshell; websites, webapps, mobile apps, APIs and a lot of other cool things. At TLM, we work on many projects, [have a look to what we do][tlm-realisations].

### [SagLac IO][saglacio]

I gave a few presentations at the  about awesome subjects such as Coffeescript, [HUBOT - Improve and reduce employee efficiency][hubot-presentation] and [SaltStack][saltstack-presentation]. I'll keep sharing my presentations on my website.

### [Totema Studio][totemastudio]

I started a partnership with some fiends, an independent video game Studio where I build awesome games with very talented people.
