Hi,  
Welcome to the source code of my personal website :v:.

## Development

You can edit files in repository directly from github and send PRs if you find typos. If you want to go further, you can install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), fork this repo and do whatever you want :tada:.

## Running this website locally

- Create a new page:

```bash
hugo new section_name/filename
```

- Build a site to the `./public/` directory:

```bash
hugo
```

- Build a site including pages that are marked as a "draft":

```bash
hugo --buildDrafts
```

- Build a site to a given directory:

```bash
hugo --destination path/to/destination
```

- Build a site, start up a webserver to serve it, and automatically reload when pages are edited:
```bash
hugo server
```
